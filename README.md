# arche

Arche (pronounced, like the greek, with a long "a" for the "e" the
end) is a Hypermedia resource discovery service.  Taking it's name
from the ancient Greek concept, it's connotations include
'beginning', 'origin', and 'authority'.  Using Arche, hypermedia
clients _begin_ arche.  The collection of entry points it maintains
represent the authorizative resources in the known set of SOA platform
resources. From the links a client receives from Arche, a hypermedia
can find.

## Current Support

Arche is in the initial phase.  It currently publishes 3 resources:
1.  A entry point resource represented in the generic hypermedia format
  `application/hal+json`
2. A DiscoverableResource, represented as a `application/hal+json`
3. Alps profiles represented as `application/apls+json`
